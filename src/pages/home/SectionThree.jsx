                    <p className="font-semibold" >Thought experiments make it obvious that this idea is memetic, and just has not been tried in the market. Once one initial company opens up this model, many more will follow and copy:</p>
                    <p className="mt-5" >For the same price as a Louie Vuitton bag, a permanent shelter can be built in Bangladesh for a family in need. This gives rise to the idea that anytime someone walks into a designer store and purchased an item, they are having to burn down a house (most making this decision unknowingly). </p>

                    <p className="mt-5" >Based on the principle “if a penny saved is a penny earned” we can extrapolate that to a Louie bag is a home burned. But just telling someone not to flex is not going to solve the problem. If we really want to win this war, we just need to sell higher status, for the same price.</p>
                    <p className="mt-5" >Imagine trying to connect with a luxury purse buyer as protestors outside of a designer store. Rather than simply protesting their spending on that good, we need to sell them a better version of what they are buying. </p>
                    <p className="mt-5" >Protests outside of stores that sell meat where stands are set up showing customers videos of the harmed animals may not be a great way to connect with the target audience, and often cause a greater divide in mindsets.</p>
                    <p className="mt-5" >In this case volunteers or employees could stand outside of luxury goods markets, sporting the aligned luxury merch. Rodeo drive for example is a notorious spot where every designer store not only has a shop, but theres a steady flow of customers. </p>
                    <p className="mt-5" >Social media accounts devoted to making content here are already massively viral amassing hundreds of millions of views interviewing buyers. Each successful conversion, would make for a viral video and an ad set, bringing potentially thousands of new customers while kickstarting educating the world of the low status of wasteful spending now that a better alternative exists. </p>

                    <p className="mt-5" >Ultimately, the more projects that promote this new line of thinking, the more people think others think this way, the more status will align culturally with its true nature. Watching others do good for the world has always given us more hope for humanity.  We believe the flippening of status has the potential to solve the worlds greatest cause of poverty, the failed distribution of wealth worldwide. </p>
                    <p className="mt-5" >We don’t need to enforce rules where people are forced to give up their things, we need brands that invest in education for the masses to wake up to what real status/value is and place higher alternatives into the market. </p>
                    <p className="mt-5" >With the release  of more and more globally disruptive technology, anxiousness about our focus on making sure things goes right becomes more apparent. By educating the world on alignment of using money and power for good from the most basic layer of apparel we will begin to cause this shift. With the right priming, a large amount of legacy wealth will be funneled into shifting the global workforce into focusing on the worlds greatest problems. </p>
